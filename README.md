'23-'24 Projects


Hello! Welcome to my GitHub!

Files "buzzer.c", "lcd.c", "project.c", "rotary.c", and "serial.c" are all part of my Speed Trap project.
This project employs several Arduino timers, different ISRs, and a RS-232 serial interface to create a speed trap.
The hardware related to this project includes phototransistors, a rotary encoder, a servo motor, a buzzer, an LCD,
LEDs, and an Arduino wired onto a breadboard.
